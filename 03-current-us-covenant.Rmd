#  The U.S. today: A contested covenant

A central confusion in the U.S. today concerns the disputed terms of our unwritten social covenant, and confusion over the difference between our covenant and our Constitution.

### The U.S. has a *de facto* social covenant

The U.S. has a written social contract: the Constitution.

The U.S. has an *unwritten* social covenant. In fact, more than one.

Our social covenant is spread over a few places: The Declaration of Independence. The Preamble to the Constitution. The Bill of Rights. The Pledge of Allegiance.


### The social convenant of the U.S. is *contested*

Some basic terms of our social covenant have never been settled.

Who is a full member of the community?

What are the rights and obligations of community members to one another?

What role does religion and religious scripture hold in setting the terms of the covenant -- if any?
